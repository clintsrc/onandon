# EXAMPLE Deploy Check v2+
#
# This example captures an enhanced version of the deployment script for the next
# version: it ensures that the Merge pull request option is only available for
# branches being merged from develop to main. It also includes a linter job. It 
# wasn't practical to implement it for this exercise because it reports 600+ errors!
#
# Executes for any PR or Merge pull request to the main branch. PR changes don't
# currently do anything, but it is extensible for adding final pre-release actions
# or tests like linting.
#
# Executes a deployment to Render for Merge pull request (push) action to the main
# branch, but the push would only be available with all of the other jobs pass.
#
# The script can be monitored on a pull request's Checks tab
